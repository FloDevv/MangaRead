## Usage üöÄ

> Note: For a practical example of a manga and anime folder structure, refer to the public folder of this project. You can have a folder who have a manga and anime folder inside it.

### Manga

Follow these steps to set up your manga:

1. Rename your main manga folder to match the name of the manga. Inside this main folder, create another folder named "manga". Within this "manga" folder, create subfolders for each volume, following the naming convention "Volume 01", "Volume 02", and so on.
2. Within each volume folder, add the images for each page. The images should be named in the format "01-001.webp", "01-002.webp", etc. The first number represents the chapter, while the second number represents the page number.

### Anime

Follow these steps to set up your anime:

1. Rename your main anime folder to match the name of the anime. Inside this main folder, create another folder named "anime". Within this "anime" folder, create subfolders for each season, following the naming convention "Season 01", "Season 02", and so on.
2. Within each season folder, add the video files for each episode. The video files should be named in the format "01-001.mp4", "01-002.mp4", etc. The first number represents the season, while the second number represents the episode number.

After setting up your manga and anime folders, you can run the following commands to install dependencies, build the project, and start the server:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm run start
```

> Note: You have to rebuild the project every time you add a new manga but for anime videos you don't have to rebuild the project since the videos are loaded dynamically via api.

> Tips: You can use AI like ChatGPT to create a python script to rename the images for you and convert them to webp format if needed.

## Self-Hosting üñ•Ô∏è

Support for Docker is currently under development. In the meantime, you can host the website on your own server by following the usage instructions provided above.
