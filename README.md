## Usage üöÄ

1. Rename your manga folder to the name of the manga. Inside this folder, create subfolders for each volume, named like "Tome 01", "Tome 02", etc.
2. Inside each volume folder, add the images of the pages. These should be named like "1-001.webp", "1-002.webp", etc (the first number is the chapter and the second is the page number).
3. Place the manga folder in the public folder of the project.
4. Run `npm run build` and `npm run start` to start the server.
5. Access your manga at localhost:3000.

> Note: You can use AI like ChatGPT to create a python script to rename the images for you and convert them to webp format if needed.

## Self-Hosting üñ•Ô∏è

Support for Docker is currently under development. In the meantime, you can host the website on your own server by following the usage instructions provided above.
